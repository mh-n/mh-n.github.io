	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Michelle H. Nguyen,</span> and I'm a 3rd year PhD candidate in  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/"> Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University</a>.</p>
	<p>I am advised by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/casey-taylor">Dr. Casey Overby Taylor</a> in <span itemprop="affiliation">the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://tirilab.github.io/">Translational Informatics Research and Innovation (TIRI) Lab @ Johns Hopkins University</a></span>.</p>

	<p>Broadly, we are interested in leveraging bioinformatics and data science techniques to advance precision medicine and public health. Within this space, my goals are to develop genomic clinical decision support tools as well as patient-facing interfaces with chatbots and natural language processing. My hope is that these tools can promote wider patient access to high quality health care.</p>
