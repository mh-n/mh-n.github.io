	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Michelle H. Nguyen,</span> and I'm a 5th year PhD candidate in  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/"> Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University</a>.</p>
	<p>I am advised by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/casey-taylor">Dr. Casey Overby Taylor</a> in <span itemprop="affiliation">the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://tirilab.github.io/">Translational Informatics Research and Innovation (TIRI) Lab @ Johns Hopkins University</a></span>.</p>

	<p>Over the past six years of my PhD, I have focused on integrating data science solutions into clinical systems through collaborative research with key domain stakeholders. By prioritizing stakeholder perspectives, I have developed more usable and effective approaches to address healthcare delivery challenges. In the process of this research, I have grown increasingly interested in how artificial intelligence (AI) tools have influenced the lives of both patients and providers, shaping the ways patients receive care and how providers practice. As generative AI is further embedded into our collective consciousness (and in many ways, becomes a new collaborator in our lives), the goal for my research is to design adaptive, human-centered AI systems to better mitigate potential harm and maximize benefit for all users. </p>
